This is the recipie for the cream cheese cookies. This recipe has been in my family for generations and it has now been passed down to me. I love everything with cream cheese from Carrot Cake to Red Velvet Cupcakes so it will come as no surprise that I am OBSESSED with these cookies. So soft, like clouds and the flavor is just on point, not too sweet, just right with lovely notes of cream cheese and vanilla.
